# Gesture-Recognition

# Problem Statement:
In a home electronics company which manufactures Televisions you want introduce a feature which identifies 5 different gestures performed by user which will help users control TV with out remote

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

# About Dataset:

The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.

The data is in a zip file. The zip file contains a 'train' and a 'val' folder with two CSV files for the two folders. These folders are in turn divided into subfolders where each subfolder represents a video of a particular gesture. Each subfolder, i.e. a video, contains 30 frames (or images). Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos).

# Architecture:

Out of 30 frames we have in frame i have used only 5 frames per video (Odd numbered frames) so that it will reduce number of parameters to be trained

I used a bit transfer learning here from inception models

1) Inception model traning 9 layers
2) Two GRU layers 64 and 128 Units
3) One Dense layer 256 neurons
4) SOftmax

Validation Accuracy is 0.89 and Train Accuracy is 0.99
